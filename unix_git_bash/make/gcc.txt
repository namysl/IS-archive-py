gcc -S
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.
           The output is in the form of an assembler code file for each
           non-assembler input file specified.

           By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made
           by replacing the suffix .c, .i, etc., with .s.

           Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.


gcc -E
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler
           proper.  The output is in the form of preprocessed source
           code, which is sent to the standard output.

           Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.
